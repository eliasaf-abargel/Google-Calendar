The extract_pdf_data.py script must be run to turn the pdf document into a json file,

Create an api with the headers against Google Calendar, and save the settings under the credentials.json file.

Run the second script schedule-google.py, a Google browser will open, 

connect with the desired email and the token.json file will be downloaded to the computer and then everything will be automatically added to the calendar.
